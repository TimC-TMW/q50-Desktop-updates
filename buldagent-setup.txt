Introduction:
=============
The purpose of this file is to outline the special instructions that were completed on setting up the L53H build on the build agents
as it is a middleman build which is a Ruby Framework and utilizes Ruby Gems.



Setup Part 1:
=============
Difference between Windows and CentOS is that there is a default JS Engine.

To resolve this the following was added to the GemFile:

	gem 'therubyracer', :platforms => :ruby

And the following command was run:

	bundle install

And the build was able to execute succesfully.



Setup Part 2:
=============
With recent modifications to make the project build to the /l53h directory, the following was also needed inside the GemFile:

	gem 'libv8', '~> 3.11.8', :platforms => :ruby

But due to the Nature of CentOS, in order to install libv8 the following command was needed to be run:

	sudo gem install libv8 --version=3.11.8.4

Followed by:

	bundle install

Which will allow it to succesfully update.
